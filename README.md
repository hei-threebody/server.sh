# server.sh
a basic sh for myself to quickly init a new server (and then destory it)

I am working on a tiny project for thesis, which needs a great deal of computing power. Howerer, I am only a helpless student. There is no way but to init a new gpu server on tencent's cloud when my code can definitely work well on cheap server, (and when all things done, destory it). So I need a script to  quickly init a server.
I know it's a good way to save an image before destory it, but the true is that I just want to init a useless repository in github ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
